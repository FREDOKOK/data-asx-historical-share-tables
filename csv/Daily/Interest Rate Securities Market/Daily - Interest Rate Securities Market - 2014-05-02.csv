Note: 1) Yields are indicative only. No account is taken of transaction costs, optionality or likely market movements at conversion/maturity. These may have a significant impact for certain securities or where there is a short term remaining.,
2) Some securities have a multiple maturity/conversion dates at the issuers option. In this case the date which is least advantageous to the holder is used. Key: h - at the discretion of the holder; i - at the discretion of the issuer; m - on maturity,
3) Some securities have currently suspended coupon payment. In these cases the implied yield assumes these payments were made. We are working closely with the ASX to resolve this issue.,
