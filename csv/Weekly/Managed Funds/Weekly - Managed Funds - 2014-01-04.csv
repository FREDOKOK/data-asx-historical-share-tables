"HOW TO READ THE MANAGED FUNDS TABLES:  Tables show unit trusts. Funds are then grouped together by the assets they invest in, showing latest-available entry and exit prices, one- and three-year returns, and Morningstar Rating from one to five stars. Funds are ranked by alphabetical order within categories. The Morningstar Rating is an assessment of a fund's past performance - based on both return and risk - which shows how similar investments compare with their competitors. A high rating alone is insufficient basis for an investment decision. Questions/More Information: Phone 1 800 03 44 55 or online help.au@morningstar.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
